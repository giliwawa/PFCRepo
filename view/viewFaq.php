		<h5>-How to pay?</h5>
		<p>Our primary way of payment is online payment by MDinar credit cards.

For our customers in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Sweden and Norway we also offer other payment says "offline" (eg by bank transfer).

If you make a payment "offline", the time taken for your web space will be ready a little longer. Regarding this subject, thank you refer to the section "How long will my web space active, if I order now?"</p>
		<h5>-Do you offer a secure payment via your website?</h5>
		<p>Yes, it is very secure.

An online payment by credit card is done atravers secure connection, encrypted in 128 bit. We do not save or store any data on your credit card, it means that it is impossible to find / recreate the data you entered in our system when you order online.</p>
		<h5>-How long will be my web space active, if I order now?</h5>
		<p>Most paid by credit card orders are processed immediately.

If you choose to pay by a method "offline", it will be necessary to send us the signed domain registration form, so we can process your order. When you place your order you will receive an email with confirmation of your order. In this email you will also find the link to the domain registration form.

In some cases we will ask you to return the signed domain registration form even if you have chosen to pay online via credit card. This may be due to problems of verification of your payment and this is a security measure quite normal. However, if you are asked to return a signed domain registration form, this does not necessarily mean that there is a problem with your credit card payment.</p>
